            <p>6) A traveller wants to cross a river with his lizard, chicken, and a bag of corn from shore A to shore B. Only the traveller can row a boat which can carry the traveller and another item. Lizard will eat the chicken if the two are left alone. Chicken will eat the corn if the two are left alone.

            <ul>
                <li>First, the traveller should take the chicken with him first from shore A to shore because the lizard will not eat a bag of corn.</li>
                <li>Second, the traveller should take a bag of corn from shore A to shore B.</li>
                <li>Then, he should take chicken back from shore B to shore A.</li>
                <li>After that, he should take the lizard corn from shore A to shore B.</li>
